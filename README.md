# Gradle Killer for Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA

This plugin kills Gradle tasks using the system task manager with just one click. No more struggling with "ps" or playing Russian roulette with "java.exe" processes! Just click the icon in the "Run" section and you're done!

*NOTE:* The plugin only works on Windows Vista (or newer) and Unix machines (with the pgrep command).
